# CFPS-Multivariate-Statistical-Data-Analysis
Multivariate Statistical Data Analysis of a Cell-Free Protein synthesis: This work provides necessary data, scripts and functions useful to provide important insights that can help support the operation and control of CFPS processes. This work was used to provide the results provided in the article "Multivariate statistical data analysis of cell-free protein synthesis towards monitoring and control.", AIChE Journal. The prediction accuracy resuslts of the different algorithms change significantly from the published work due to the normalization of yield, aggregate% and monomer% done for confidentiality protection reasons.

This work was supported by the UK Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/P006485/1] and a consortium of industrial users and sector organizations in the Future Targeted Healthcare Manufacturing Hub hosted by UCL Biochemical Engineering in collaboration with UK universities. CFPS is envisioned as a potential solution for the simplified, robust, flexible and local production of stratified or personalised biotherapeutic medicines, as might be necessary in a future pharmacy or hospital setting.
